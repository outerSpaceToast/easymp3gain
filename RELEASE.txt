0.2.0 alpha:
easyMP3Gain is a graphical user interface for mp3gain. The Interface looks similar to the one available for Windows.
It's a native GTK/GTK+ application, so it runs on Linux and FreeBSD/OpenBSD (not tested yet).
A QT-Version will be available soon.
This contains new features like album-analyzing.

known bugs:
GTK-Version crashes, when any operation is performed and mp3gain is not installed.
