0.3.9 beta:
easyMP3Gain is a graphical user interface for mp3gain. The Interface looks similar to the one available for Windows.
It's a native GTK/GTK+ application, so it runs on Linux and FreeBSD/OpenBSD (not tested yet).
A QT-Version will be available soon.
This version contains new features like ogg-vorbis and aac-support, recursive adding on NTFS-drives, viewable console-output, etc.

known bugs:
Drag&Drop does not work in the QT-Version!
