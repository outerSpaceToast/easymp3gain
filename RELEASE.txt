0.4.0 beta:
easyMP3Gain is a graphical user interface for mp3gain, aacgain and vorbisgain. The Interface looks similar to the one available for Windows.
It's a native GTK/GTK2 application, so it runs on Linux and FreeBSD/OpenBSD (not tested yet).
A QT4-Version will be available soon.
This version contains new features like:
 - AAC support (for ".mp4" and ".m4a" files, not raw ".aac")
 - Ogg-Vorbis support (".ogg" and ".oga")
 - GUI saves settings (target volume, etc..)
 - Recursive adding of files now works on NTFS-drives
 - New process-module (internally)
 - Console Output can be viewed
 - Localization-system changed to GNU gettext
 - Automatic album detection (by directory)
 - Accepts files as argument
 - Several other improvements

known bugs:
 - Drag & Drop does not work in the QT4-Version!
 - MultiSelect does not work in the QT4-Version!
