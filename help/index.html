<h5>Adding files to the list:</h5>
There are 3 possibilities to add files to the list.
<ol><li>Select "Add files" or "Add files recursively" in the menu "File".</li>
<li>Drag & Drop: Drag files from a file manager and drop them into the easyMP3Gain window.</li>
<li>start easyMP3Gain with parameters. Some examples:
<TABLE border="0" width="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><div class="code">easymp3gain '/home/song1.mp3' '/home/mymusic/'</div></td>
      <td>adds song1.mp3 and all songs in /home/mymusic</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div class="code">easymp3gain -r '/home/mymusic'</div></td>

<h5>MP3/AAC-Files vs. Ogg-Vorbis-Files:</h5>
<p>MP3-Files are handled in an other way than Ogg-Vorbis-Files.
The handling depends on the backends mp3gain and vorbisgain.</p>

<p>Mp3-Files can be analyzed and "hard-gained". In the analyze-process volume-tags are written in the mp3-file.
The Column "Track Gain" shows, how much the file will be gained when clicking on "Gain".
In this process the volume of the files is changed (hard-gained).</p>

<p>Vorbis-files can't be "hard-gained". If you click on "Gain" the file is analyzed and the difference to 89dB is written in the file (only as a tag).
Some media-players read this tag and adjust the volume. In contrast to "mp3gain" "vorbisgain" has a fixed reference at 89dB.</p>
<p><h5>Example:</h5>
easyMP3Gain shows: Volume: 98.8; Gain: (-9.8).<br>This means, the file has a real volume of 98.8, but the player reads the gain-tag and adjusts the volume to: 98.8-9.8 = 89 dB!
</p>

<p><h5>Why is there a "?" in the "Album Volume" column?</h5>
There is no information about the album volume in ogg-vorbis files. Only the album-gain tags can be read.</p>

<p><h5>Analyzing vs. Gaining Ogg-Vorbis-Files:</h5>
What's the difference between "Analyze" and "Gain" when working with ogg-files?<br>
<strong>Nothing</strong>. When working with these files it doesen't matter wether you click on "analyze" or "gain". It's not necessary do run both of them.
